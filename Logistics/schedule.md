## Project Timeline
-------------------
Internal schedule for completing software goals.

Creation Date: January 15, 2021

Team: The Nerd Herd

Author: Zeke Petersen

* Important dates:
  * First mandatory meeting - 1/21 @ 10:30am
  * Second mandatory meeting - 2/4 @ 10:30am
  * Project presentation - 2/5
  * Project due - 2/10


### Phase 1
-----------
* Items to complete:
  * Full functionality and test suites of the preprocessing, modeling, and visualization modules
  * Basic tree structure (for manipulating the tree, not necessarily the pipelining functionality yet)
  * Write SRS and SDS documents
* Goal: Finish Phase 1 by 1/28

UPDATE as of 1/29:
* Nearly done with Phase 1, ran into hiccups understanding the given function signatures and general data flow. Should be finishing the rest of the core functionality today, though unclear if the evaluation and visualization code is close.


### Phase 2
-----------
* Goal: Finish Phase 2 by 1/5
  * We want to establish the tree and node classes by 1/31
  * We want to have a method for adding nodes to a tree by 1/2 so we can test and develop the rest of the methods
  * We want to have the execution functions and the rest described in step 5 by 1/4 (though the save/load functions can wait, as they are not critical for a demonstration on 1/5)

UPDATE as of 2/5:
* Tree and node classes have been established, though will have minor changes as
the data splitting steps for non-pre-split input files get closer to completion.
All other Phase 1 steps are complete and nodes can be added to the tree. Only about
half of the desired tree methods have been written yet and we are assigning out
those tasks in an ad hoc fashion as team members finish their tasks at hand.


### Phase 3 (last minute tasks and cleanup)
-------------------------------------------
* Goal: Finish Phase 3 by 1/9
  * Ensure documentation is up to date and all tracking has been reported
  * Convert all relevant .docx or .xlsx files to .pdf
  * Update README to have instructions for installation/use
  * Ensure the saving and loading functions are working
