Tracking for meeting date, time, duration, and content.

### 1/13/2020 - Initial Team Meeting
------------------------------------
6:00pm-6:20pm (all members present)
* Divided up the project into two phases:
  * Phase 1: Create core modules outlined in project document
  * Phase 2: Integrate modules and build tree
* Divided up initial work into the following roles:
  * Logan - Preprocessing
  * Jarett - Modeling
  * Jack - Data Visualization
  * Callista - Pipelining/ Initial tree design
  * Zeke - Team Leader
* Goal before first meeting with client (scheduled early on 1/19 at 12pm) will be to become familiar with assigned module and identify clarifying questions

### 1/19/2020 - Mini Team Meeting
---------------------------------
12:00pm-12:20pm (all members present)
* Established Thursdays at 6:00pm as weekly checkin meetings
* Clarified that Callista will begin creating the n-ary tree

### 1/20/2020 - First Meeting with Client
-----------------------------------------
6:00pm-6:15pm (all members present)
* Clarified questions about the project-- important takeaways included:
    * The end result will essentially be an API for a programmer that wishes to create and modify trees.
    * Use DFS to minimize memory for storing the tree.
    * "Backtracking" is not precisely what was meant-- that was more of another way to say tree manipulations.
    * Preprocessing will take some reasonable judgement calls, for example, when missing data can be imputed or not or how to add timestamps to begin with.

### 1/21/2020 - First Mandatory Meeting
---------------------------------------
10:30am-10:50am (Zeke, Logan, Callista)
* Presented documents that we have now
* Clarified that we only have one user class to consider (data scientist) and example use cases are in the Jupyter Notebooks provided
* Clarified that the diagrams are just a graphical schematic for how the modules fit together
* Clarified that we can and likely should be wrapping the pandas functions that are the same as the project specified functions
* The feedback is concern over how little code has been written thus far, however, since we have plans for self-imposed deadlines, it may be nothing to worry about

### 1/21/2020 - Weekly Team Meeting
-----------------------------------
6:00pm-6:30pm (all members present)
* Established next Thursday (1/28) as the deadline for finalizing the modules and basic tree operations
* Discussed overall system design
